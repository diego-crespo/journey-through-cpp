The Goal
1. Beginning c++ through game programming
2. C++ Primer
3. Sfml game development by example
4. Effective c++

* Introduction
Editor->Source->Compiler->ObjectCode->Linker->ExecutableFile

Linker links object files to any external files as necessary Then creates an
executable

#include <iostream> is called a preprocessor directive they always start with #

*preprocessor*- runs before the compiler and substitutes

surrounding with < > tells the compiler it can find the file amongst all the
other files that came with it

*header file*- A file that you include in your programs

*cout*-  is an object, defined in the file iostream. It sends data to the
standard output stream. Which in most programs is the console/terminal

*<<*- output operator. Used like a funnel. Funnels open side to pointy side

*>>*- extraction operator. Used with cin

*std*- is a namespace. Like an area code of a phone number

*::* scope resolution operator. You prefix a namespace with it

*using namespace ...*- a using directive, gives access to items in the std
namespace


*identifier*- name of a variable. Must only contain numbers, letters underscores.
Can't start with a number. Can't be a keyword (reserved word)

*cin >> fuel*- assing a value to fuel

Defining new names for types

- typdef unsigned short int ushort; defines ushort as another name for unsigned
short int.
